### The plan

- we do some more arduino tutorials to get more familiar with the whole thing
- we hook-up the motor and do experiments with it to figure out how it works
- get a proper copter motor and learn to control it
- get a frame and three additional motors
- create code to control all 4 motors
- buy a gyroscope and learn how to use it
- control the motors based on the data from the gyroscope
