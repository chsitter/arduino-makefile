### The plan

- we do some more arduino tutorials to get more familiar with the whole thing
- we hook-up the motor and do experiments with it to figure out how it works
- get a proper copter motor and learn to control it
- get a frame and three additional motors
- create code to control all 4 motors
- buy a gyroscope and learn how to use it
- control the motors based on the data from the gyroscope
# CHIC (Cool HelI Copter) feature list



List of feature we'd like to have some day:

- it should
	- **fly**
	- have a video camera
	- be able to sustain stable hover flight on it's own
	- be able to follow a predefined flgith (GPS) track/route
	- be remotely controlled from your smartphone/computer
	- be able to land on it's own (on flat surface)
	- have extension points for various sensors (temperature, humidity, â€¦)
	- be able to avoid obstacles on it's own
	- fire nerf guns :)
